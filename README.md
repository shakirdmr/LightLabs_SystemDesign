# System Design — Daily Learning Journal

A public, open-source repo where I learn **system design** from the ground up — both high-level (HLD) and low-level (LLD) — one day at a time.

Everything here is written to be simple and easy to follow so anyone can learn alongside me.

---

## What's This About?

I'm building real things and documenting the journey as I go.

- **High-Level Design (HLD)** — how systems are architected: scalability, load balancing, databases, caching, APIs, and more.
- **Low-Level Design (LLD)** — the code-level details: data structures, algorithms, protocols, and how things actually work under the hood.

No fluff. Just daily progress, simple explanations, and working code.

## Structure

Each topic gets its own folder. Inside, you'll find daily notes and code.

```
SystemDesign/
└── HTTP_SERVER_C_C++/     # Building an HTTP server from scratch in C/C++
    ├── day1.c
    └── ...
```

## Who Is This For?

Anyone who wants to learn system design by doing — not just reading theory.
Follow along at your own pace. The docs are written to be beginner-friendly.

## How to Follow Along

1. Clone the repo
2. Pick a topic folder
3. Start from `day1` and go in order
4. Read the code and the comments — they explain everything

## Topics Covered (so far)

| Topic | Type | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| HTTP Server in C/C++ | LLD | In Progress |

More topics coming as I learn them.

## Open Source

This is fully open source. Fork it, follow it, learn from it — do whatever helps you grow.

If something is unclear, open an issue and I'll improve the docs.
